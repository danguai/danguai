Hi I am Daniel. ðŸ‘‹

I'm originally from Venezuela,Â a software engineer with 20+ years of motion design experience. I just graduated from App Academy, and I have experience coding in Javascript and Python. I have 4 full stack projects that I have worked on utilizing either a Javascript / Express back-end and a React / Redux front-end, or a Python / Flask back-end and a React / Redux front end. I have worked mainly with a PostgreSQL database.
